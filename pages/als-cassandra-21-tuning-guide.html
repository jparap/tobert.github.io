<p>Al's Cassandra 2.1 Tuning Guide (2015)</p>

<h1>Assumptions</h1>

<ul>
<li>Jr. Systems Administrator level Linux CLI skills</li>
<li>familiarity with Cassandra 2.1 and/or Datastax Enterprise 4.7</li>
<li>basic statistics</li>
</ul>

<h1>Errors, Omissions, and Updates</h1>

<p>This guide is not intended to be complete and focuses on techniques I've used
to track down performance issues on production clusters.</p>

<p>This version of the guide has not had a lot of peer review, so there may be some
mistakes as well as things I'm just outright wrong about.</p>

<p>If you find any errors, please (really!) submit an issue at
<a href="https://github.com/tobert/tobert.github.io">https://github.com/tobert/tobert.github.io</a>.</p>

<h1>Go-to Observation Tools</h1>

<p>Observation is a critical skill to develop as a systems administrator. A wide
variety of tools are available for observing systems in different ways. Many of
them use the same few system metrics in different ways to provide you with a
view into your system. Understanding low-level metrics (e.g. /proc/vmstat)
allows you to better reason about higher-level displays such as OpsCenter
graphs.</p>

<p>It's important to remember that most metrics we consume are some kind of
aggregate; computers today are so fast that precise bookkeeping is too expensive
to do all of the time. The critical implication of this is that we have to read
between the lines; averages lie and the larger the sample is, the larger the
lie.</p>

<p>Monitoring systems are tempting choices for gathering performance metrics, but
they usually end up having to trade off resolution for economy of storage and
rarely have a resolution higher than 1 sample/minute. Low-resolution metrics are
certainly useful for capacity planning, useless for performance tuning. One
exception is collectd + related tooling configured at a 10s resolution by
default. This is much better than average but not good enough for all
situations, but still check it out.</p>

<h2>dstat</h2>

<p>dstat is by far my favorite tool for observing performance metrics on a Linux
machine. It provides the features of many tools all in one with high-resolution
(1s). My go-to command to start it is:</p>

<p>dstat -lrvn 10</p>

<p><img src="image_1.png" alt="image alt text" />
</p>

<p>That runs dstat with the load average (-l), disk IOPS (-r), vmstats (-v), and
network throughput (-n). The 10 tells dstat to keep updating the current line
every second and roll to a new line every 10 seconds. It can do fancier like
report per-disk metrics and per-network interface, not to mention all of the
various plugins. Dig in. This the most useful stats tool on the Linux command
line. If you ask me for help, be prepared to get screenshots of a few minutes'
activity like the one above.</p>

<p>Reading the Matrix: I leave dstat running inside GNU Screen (or tmux if you
prefer) pretty much all the time I'' connected to a cluster. Even when there
aren't problems. Maybe especially then. While running benchmarks or production
load, I'll flip through my screens (ctrl-a n) and glance at the dstat output.
Once it has been running for a little while, the whole terminal should be full.
What I'm looking for is vertical consistency (or lack thereof) and outliers.  On
a fully warmed-up system, memory should be around 95% in-use, with most of it in
the cache column.  CPUs should be in use with no more than 1-2% of iowait and
2-15% system time. The network throughput should mirror whatever the application
is doing, so if it's cassandra-stress, it should be steady.  If it's a Hadoop
job writing in big batches, I'll expect big spikes. Think through the workload
and learn what to expect <em>and</em> learn what is normal.</p>

<h3>reading vmstats</h3>

<p>I am a huge fan of dstat. Back in the Bad Old Days, I had to switch between 3-4
tools to get an idea of how a system was doing. With dstat I can see all the
key metrics in one view and that is important. With a snapshot every 10
seconds, a full-screen terminal can show me the last few minutes of data,
making it easy to scan the columns visually for patterns and anomalies.
This is plain old pattern recognition most of the time; even without knowing
what the stats mean, you should be able to correlate changes in system stats
with changes in the client workload. For practice, fire up dstat on an idle
Cassandra node, then fire up a simple cassandra-stress load. The change in
metrics over the first couple minutes of load are instructive. How long does
it take to level out? Does it level out or are metrics swinging wildly?
Once the patterns are identified, then it's time to understand whats happening
under the hood. Going from left to right of my usual dstat -vn 10:</p>

<h4>run/blocked/new tasks</h4>

<p>These show how many processes or threads were running/blocked/created
during the sample window. run=~n_cores is ideal for ROI/efficiency,
but makes a lot of admins nervous. run=2*n_cores isn't necessarily bad.
run&gt;cores is healthy with some head room. Any blocked processes is
considered bad and you should immediately look at the iowait %.
1-2% iowait isn't necessarily a problem, but it usually points at
storage as a bottleneck.</p>

<h4>memory</h4>

<p>Memory is perhaps the easiest. Used will usually be your heap +
offheap + ~500MB. If it's significantly higher, find out where that memory
went! Buffers should be a couple hundred MB, rarely more than a gigabyte.
Cache should account for almost all the remaining memory if data &gt; RAM.
Free memory should be in the 200-300MB range unless the working data size is
smaller than installed memory.</p>

<h4>swap</h4>

<p>dstat shows the swap columns along with memory. These should always be zeroes.
Any swap activity whatsoever is a source of hiccups and must be eliminated
before anything else.</p>

<h4>disk throughput</h4>

<p>This tells you how many bytes are going in and out of the storage every second.
It is fairly accurate and tends to be more useful than IOPS. There isn't a
standard range here. Try saturation testing the cluster with large objects to
find out what the high end is, then try to size the cluster/tuning to keep it
25% or so below peak load, or more if there is a tight SLA. You will often see
activity on the disks after a load test has completed and that's most likely
compaction.</p>

<h4>interrupts (int) &amp; context switches (ctx)</h4>

<p>An interrupt occurs when a device needs the CPU to do something, such as pick
up data from the network or disks. Context switches occur when the kernel has
to switch out a task on the CPU. Most interrupts are tied to a ctx, which is
why ctx is almost always &gt; interrupts. On a healthy system, ctx should be
20-40% higher than interrupts. If it's a lot higher, take a look at system
call counts with strace. futex is almost always the top call and indicates
a high amount of lock contention.</p>

<h4>user/system/idle/wait/hiq/siq CPU time</h4>

<p>User time is CPU time used to run userland processes, i.e. JVM threads.
System time is time spent in kernel code. Idle time is exactly as it sounds.
hiq/siq are for time spent processing hardware and soft interrupts. These
are usually zeroes but you'll occasionally see siq time under heavy load.
A few % is fine. Any more indicates a serious problem with the kernel
and/or hardware.</p>

<h4>network send/recv</h4>

<p>Shows the amount of data flowing over the network.
I can saturate 10gig links with Cassandra 2.1 and large objects, so
this is more important to look at than it has been in the past. This shows
how much data is flowing over CQL and storage protocols.
The differential between network / disk io / CPU usage gives a good picture
of how efficiently a system is running. I do this in my head….</p>

<h2>sjk-plus</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/aragozin/jvm-tools">https://github.com/aragozin/jvm-tools</a>
is the newest addition to the stable and has one tool in particular that is
useful for DSE: ttop a.k.a. &quot;thread top&quot;, which is exactly what it sounds like.
While top and htop are useful for looking at processes, they cannot tell which JVM
thread is which and that's where ttop comes in. It's a single jar so it's easy to
push to a machine and does not require any GUI so it works fine over ssh. So far,
I've found the following command to be the most useful:</p>

<p><img src="image_2.png" alt="image alt text" />
</p>

<p>Which threads trend towards the top is workload-dependent. Most threads in DSE are
named except for all the stuff in the shared pool, which is a mess of things
unfortunately. On the upside, in my observations of clusters under load they are
not a common source of problems.</p>

<p>The real killer feature is the heap allocation rates, which are directly correlatable
to GC work. Try setting -o ALLOC instead of CPU to see which threads are putting
pressure on GC.</p>

<h2>htop</h2>

<p>Most Linux users are familiar with the 'top' command but it's fairly limited in
what it can display and doesn't look as nice. htop has a nice default display
that shows per-core load and all the threads. It can also be configured by hitting
F2, which is occasionally handy when you want to sort by specific fields or
display something outside the defaults, e.g. soft page faults.</p>

<p>In the following screenshot, system time is red, nice time is blue, and user
time is green. This may not be consistent across terminals or themes. To see
the legend, hit the 'h' key.</p>

<p>@phact recommends enabling &quot;[x] Detailed CPU time&quot;
under Setup (F2) to make things like iowait and steal time visible.
Without the option, they appear to be unused capacity, which is misleading.</p>

<p><img src="image_3.png" alt="image alt text" />
</p>

<h2>powertop and i7z</h2>

<p>Powertop is not often useful, but is worth checking at least once if you're
seeing odd fluctuations in performance on bare metal. What you're looking for is
the second tab, so start it up with 'sudo powertop' then hit tab once to get to
the &quot;Idle stats&quot; tab. This will show you the &quot;C-states&quot; of the processors and
how much time is being spent in them. In short, the higher the C-state number,
the higher the latency cost to come out of it. C1E-HSW is cheaper than C3-HSW
and so on. A lot of articles about latency tuning recommend disabling C-states
altogether, but I don't think this is responsible or necessary. You probably
want to disable the deeper C-states (&gt;3) for Cassandra nodes that will be
busy. The power management code in the kernel should handle the rest.</p>

<p>The next tab is &quot;Frequency stats&quot;. This will show you if frequency scaling is
enabled on the CPU. In general, frequency scaling should never be enabled on
Cassandra servers. Even if it &quot;works&quot; (and it does), it makes the TSC clock
(the fastest one) unstable, causing more clock drift, which is bad for
Cassandra systems. Modern Xeon and AMD processors have specializations for
making the TSC more stable, so it's worth measuring before you give up on it.</p>

<p>The next couple tabs aren't very useful for Cassandra work, but the last
one is in a non-intuitive way. You want all of the items in the &quot;Tunables&quot;
tab to say &quot;Bad!&quot; Power management and high performance are almost always
at odds. You can safely ignore devices that aren't in use by Cassandra,
e.g. USB controllers and sound devices.</p>

<p><img src="image_5.png" alt="image alt text" />
</p>

<p>i7z is an alternative to powertop that was brought to my attention but
I have not tried it. <a href="https://code.google.com/p/i7z/">https://code.google.com/p/i7z/</a></p>

<h2>/proc</h2>

<p>Most of the stats displayed by the tools already discussed come from text files
in /proc. dstat reads /proc/loadavg for the load average, /proc/stat for the
VM stats, /proc/diskstats for disk IO, and so on. A few files are really handy
for quickly checking things that aren't exported by the usual tools.</p>

<p>For example, hugepages. In my experience, transparent hugepages aren't
(usually) a problem for Cassandra like they are for many other databases.
That said, you need to be able to know if your JVM is using them or not,
so the easy thing to do is:</p>

<p><img src="image_6.png" alt="image alt text" />
</p>

<p>If the AnonHugePages is slightly larger than your heap, you're all set with THP.
If you thought you disabled it, restart Cassandra again to get back to 4K pages.</p>

<p>Pro tip: you can make a top-like view of /proc files using the watch(1) command, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>watch grep Dirty /proc/meminfo
</code></pre>

<p>/proc/interrupts is useful for figuring out which CPUs are handling IO. It is often
too large to display on a screen, so a little awk or scripting may be in order to
get it down to size. For quick checks, simply cat'ing the file will do.</p>

<h2>dmesg</h2>

<p>dumps the kernel's error buffer to stdout. Sometimes you find things really quickly,
sometimes not. I almost always look at it on both healthy and problematic systems to
see if anything is going on. For example, if an application has been OOM killed,
there will be a detailed report in the dmesg log. The error buffer is a
statically-sized ring, so sometimes when things are really hairy the important
information will get scrolled off, forcing you to grep around in /var/log.</p>

<h2>strace</h2>

<p>a.k.a. the life saver. Strace has helped me discover obscure failures more than
any other tool in my toolbox. The simplest usage of strace involves printing
out every system call made by a process. Idle Cassandra systems make a huge
number of system calls, so filtering with the -e flag is highly recommended.
It can fork a process for tracing by prefixing a command (e.g. strace ls) or
you can attach to a running process with -p PID. The -f flag is required to
get useful dumps from Cassandra - it makes strace attach to all tasks (threads)
in a given process.</p>

<p>In order to trace a particular subsystem, e.g. networking, use the -e flag.
There are some preset groups of syscalls like &quot;network&quot;, “file”, and o
hers. Check out the man page.</p>

<p><img src="image_7.png" alt="image alt text" />
</p>

<p>One of the more useful ways to use strace with Cassandra is to see how often
the futex() syscall is being used. This is interesting because the syscall
is only called on contended locks. For that, use
<code>strace -f -c -e futex -p $PID</code>. Let it run for a few seconds then hit Ctrl-C.</p>

<p><img src="image_8.png" alt="image alt text" />
</p>

<h2>smartctl</h2>

<p>Most hard drives made in the last decade support a protocol called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T.">SMART</a>. SATA and SAS SSDs support
it as well and it's the first place I look when I suspect a problem with
rive. It isn't always installed by default. The package is usually called
&quot;smartmontools&quot;.</p>

<p>If the system has anything but a simple JBOD controller (e.g. SATA AHCI,
LSI SAS x008), you may need to specify the device type so smartctl can
query the HBA properly. The man page has instructions for doing so.</p>

<p>The most important section for troubleshooting is the attributes, specifically
the RAW_VALUE column. The other columns often have unreliable values,
especially the TYPE column, which always looks scarier than things really are.</p>

<p>Here is a screenshot from &quot;smartctl -A /dev/sdc&quot; on a Samsung 840 Pro SSD.
This is where you look to find out if flash cells are dying or you suspect
other kinds of errors.</p>

<p><img src="image_9.png" alt="image alt text" />
</p>

<p>The full smartctl -a output for an HDD and SSD are available as a gist:
<a href="https://gist.github.com/tobert/c3f8ca20ea3da623d143">https://gist.github.com/tobert/c3f8ca20ea3da623d143</a></p>

<h2>iperf</h2>

<p>is a network load testing tool that is quick &amp; easy to use. I use it to
find the real capability of a network interface, which is often surprisingly
lower than advertised. On bare metal, you should expect to be able to get
&gt; 900mbit/s (remember to divide by 8 for bytes!) on 1gig links. For
10gig links, you may need to use the --parallel option.</p>

<p>These screenshots show how simple it is to use iperf to find out how much
bandwidth I can get between my Linux workstation and my Mac over wifi.</p>

<p><img src="image_10.png" alt="image alt text" />
</p>

<p><img src="image_11.png" alt="image alt text" />
</p>

<p>There are a number of switches available, but most of the time you don't need them.
The most important two to add are --time and --num to set the amount of time to
run the test or the number of bytes to transmit, respectively.</p>

<h2>pcstat</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tobert/pcstat">https://github.com/tobert/pcstat</a> is a tool I
wrote out of frustration. One question we often have is whether or not a given
file is being cached by Linux. Linux itself doesn't export this information in
an easy way, so pcstat gets it via the mincore(2) system call.  The easiest way
to get it if you have Go installed is &quot;go get github.com/tobert/pcstat&quot;. This
will place a pcstat binary in $GOPATH/bin that you can scp to any Linux server.</p>

<pre><code>pcstat -bname /var/lib/cassandra/data/*/*/*-Data.db
</code></pre>

<p><img src="image_12.png" alt="image alt text" />
</p>

<h2>cl-netstat.pl</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tobert/perl-ssh-tools">https://github.com/tobert/perl-ssh-tools</a>
Another custom tool. This one logs into your whole cluster over ssh and displays
a cluster-wide view of network traffic, disk IOPS, and load averages. I use this
all the time. It's a bit of a pain to install, but it's worth it. By default it
updates every 2 seconds.</p>

<p><img src="image_13.png" alt="image alt text" />
</p>

<h1>Saturation Testing with cassandra-stress</h1>

<p>We really need an entire guide like this one for cassandra-stress. For most
performance tuning, a very simple cassandra-stress configuration is sufficient
for identifying bottlenecks by pushing a saturation load at the cluster. It is
important to keep in mind that sustained saturation load should never be used to
determine production throughput; by definition it is unsustainable. It is, on
occasion, useful to find the max saturation load, then dial it back by 10-20% as
a starting point for finding a cluster's maximum <strong>sustainable</strong> load.</p>

<p>There are two workloads in particular that expose most issues quickly, one using
small objects and the other using large objects.</p>

<h2>small objects for finding TXN/s limits</h2>

<p>Small objects running at maximum transaction throughput help expose issues with
network packets-per-second limits, CPU throughput, and as always, GC.
I've been unable to get enough throughput with small objects to stress 10gig
networks or good SSDs; for those move on to large objects. This is the easiest
test to run and is by far the most common, since it requires almost no
configuration of cassandra-stress.</p>

<p>I usually put my cassandra-stress commands in little shell scripts so it's
easier to edit and I don't have to rely on command history or, horror of
horrors, typing. For example, here's what my small-stress.sh looks like:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

export PATH=/opt/cassandra/bin:/opt/cassandra/tools/bin:$PATH

cassandra-stress \
    write \
    n=1000000 \
    cl=LOCAL_QUORUM \
    -rate threads=500 \
    -schema &quot;replication(factor=3)&quot; \
    -node 192.168.10.12
</code></pre>

<h2>large objects for finding MB/s limits</h2>

<p>Many of the times I'' asked to look at a cluster, IO is usually suspect. Small
objects tend to run up against CPU or GC bottlenecks before they have a chance
to do enough IO to show whether I'm tuning in the right direction. Using large
objects helps here.</p>

<p>In this example, I'm writing partitions with 32 columns at 2K each for a total
of 64K per partition. You will probably need to try some different values to get
things moving. Sometimes disabling durability on the CF or putting the CL on
tmpfs is useful to reduce CPU/GC load and move more IO through flushing.</p>

<pre><code>cassandra-stress \
    write \
    n=1000000 \
    cl=LOCAL_QUORUM \
    -rate threads=500 \
    -col &quot;size=fixed(2048)&quot; &quot;n=fixed(32)&quot; \
    -schema &quot;replication(factor=3)&quot; \
    -node 192.168.10.12
</code></pre>

<h1>cassandra.yaml</h1>

<p>There are three major places to find settings that impact Cassandra's
performance: the java command-line (GC, etc.), the schema, and cassandra.yaml.
Probably in that order. The inaccuracy of some comments in Cassandra configs is
an old tradition, dating back to 2010 or 2011. The infamous &quot;100mb per core&quot;
atrocity dates back a ways, but we're not here to talk about history. What you
need to know is that a lot of the advice in the config commentary is misleading.
Whenever it says “number of cores” or “number of disks” is a good time to be
suspicious. I'm n't going to rewrite the whole yaml file here, but instead cover
the few settings that should always be checked when tuning.</p>

<pre><code>commitlog_segment_recycling: false
</code></pre>

<h3>Prior to 2.1.9:</h3>

<p>The Jira linked above has most of the gritty details. TL;DR, the workaround is
to set commitlog_segment_size_in_mb &gt; commitlog_total_space_in_mb which
causes Cassandra to drop segments after use rather than reuse them.

<h2>memtables &amp; flushing</h2>

<p>One of the most common tweaks we have to make is bumping
memtable_flush_writers on systems with sufficient resources. The advice in the
stock yaml isn't bad in this case but it isn't very nuanced. Generally you can
start at 4 and see what happens. If you're seeing dropped mutations under
saturation load, try going as high as 8 but probably not much higher since 8
blocked flushwriters probably means your disks aren't up to the task and the
load needs to be scaled back.</p>

<p>I think memtable_flush_writers and memtable_cleanup_threshold should always
be set together. The default formula is:  1 / (memtable_flush_writers + 1) so
if you have a lot of flush writers, your cleanup threshold is going to be very
low and cause frequent flushing for no good reason. A safe starting value for a
cluster with few tables is 0.15 (15% of memtable space). If you have lots of
active tables, a smaller value may be better, but watch out for compaction cost.</p>

<p>Note: memtables aren't compressed so don't expect compressed sstable sizes to
line up.</p>

<h2>memtable_allocation_type: offheap_objects</h2>

<p>Offheap memtables can improve write-heavy workloads by reducing the amount of
data stored on the Java heap. 1-2GB of offheap memory should be sufficient for
most workloads. The memtable size whould be left at 25% of the heap as well,
since it is still in use when offheap is in play.</p>

<p>An additional performance boost can be realized by installing and enabling
jemalloc. On common distros this is usually a yum/apt-get install away. Worst
case you can simply install the .so file in /usr/local/lib or similar.
Instructions for configuring it are in cassandra-env.sh.</p>

<h2>concurrent_{reads,writes,counters}</h2>

<p>Like some other options, the recommendations in the comments for these are
misleading. Increasing these values allows Cassandra to issue more IO in
parallel, which is currently the best way to push the Linux IO stack. You may
also want to take a look at /sys/block/<drive>/queue/nr_requests. Start with 128
on huge machines and go as low as 32 for smaller machines.</p>

<h2>sstable compression</h2>

<p>The CPU tradeoff is almost always a net win compared to iowait or the wasted
space on the drives. Turning compression off is sometimes faster. The main
tunable is chunk_length_kb in the compression properties of a table. The
default chunk length is 128K which may be lowered either at CREATE TABLE time or
with ALTER TABLE.</p>

<p>In 2.1, uncompressed tables will use a reader with 64k buffer. If your
reads are significantly smaller than 64k, using compression to allow Cassandra
to lower that buffer size will likely be a significant win for you in terms of
IO wait, latency, and overall read throughput, even if you don't necessarily care
about the savings in disk space. In any case, aligning the buffer chunk size to
be a multiple of the disk block size (ie: xfs 4k blocks) is optimal.</p>

<h2>streaming</h2>

<p>Make sure to always set streaming_socket_timeout_in_ms to
a non-zero value. 1 hour is a conservative choice that will prevent the worst
behavior.</p>

<h1>The Java Virtual Machine</h1>

<h2>Java 8</h2>

<p>Every cluster I've touched for the last couple months has been running Java 8
with no problem. JDK8 has some nice improvements in performance across the
board, so some clusters will pick up some additional headroom just by upgrading.
Java 7 is deprecated by Oracle and is on its way out. That said, if for some
reason (e.g. inverse-conservative policies) you have to stick with JRE7, at
least try to get the last update release.</p>

<h2>OpenJDK</h2>

<p>There is some remembered pain around OpenJDK that as far as I can tell dates
back to the initial releases of it in Fedora where it was JDK6 with no JIT and a
bunch of GNU Classpath and Apache Harmony things bolted on. That didn't last too
long before Sun finished OSSing the important parts of Hotspot, making the
OpenJDK we have today that is, from the server VM's perspective, identical to
the Oracle releases of Hotspot. The critical thing to watch out for today with
OpenJDK is OS packages. Java 8 took a long time to adopt because the early
releases were buggy. Do yourself a favor and check the full version of any
OpenJDK before trusting it. If it's out of date and you still want to use
OpenJDK, check out the <a href="http://www.azulsystems.com/products/zulu">Zulu</a> packages
produced by Azul.</p>

<h2>heap estimation &amp; GC selection</h2>

<p>If you haven't read the bit about offheap from above, please check that out. In
general, our default heap size of 8GB is a good starting point for
Cassandra-only workloads. When adding in Solr, you will almost always want to
increase the heap. I've seen it set anywhere from 8GB to 32GB in production
systems. I've tested up to 256GB with G1, and while it works great, it's a waste
of pressious page cache space. G1 works best at 26-32GB, start in that range if
you have the spare RAM. When messing around with GC, you should always enable GC
logging. With newer JDK7 builds and any JDK8 build, GC log rotation is built-in
so there's no reason to have it disabled, especially in production. Some folks
prefer to leave it off in production by default because
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mechanical-sympathy/m4cGegwc-sY">GC log writes occur during STW</a>
and are synchronous, which may introduce additional hiccups.</p>

<p>Now that you have GC logging enabled you have a choice: stick with CMS (the
devil we know) or switch to G1GC (the devil we barely know).  You can get more
throughput from CMS, but it takes careful planning and testing to achieve it,
whereas with G1, you can get good performance without a lot of tweaking.</p>

<h2>useful settings for any (parallel) GC</h2>

<p>By default, Hotspot caps GC threads at 8, seemingly because of some legacy
assumptions combined with unrelated side-effects on SPARC. In any case, if the
target system has more than 8 cores, you may want to allow GC to use all of
them. This has been observed to reduce STW durations. I haven't seen any
negative side-effects. As the comments say, HT cores don't count. See
also: &quot;EC2 cores are not what you think they are&quot;.</p>

<pre><code># The JVM maximum is 8 PGC threads and 1/4 of that for ConcGC.
# Machines with &gt; 10 cores may need additional threads.
# Increase to &lt;= full cores (do not count HT cores).
#JVM_OPTS=&quot;$JVM_OPTS -XX:ParallelGCThreads=16&quot;
#JVM_OPTS=&quot;$JVM_OPTS -XX:ConcGCThreads=16&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Reference processing isn't usually a big deal for Cassandra, but in some
workloads it does start to show up in the GC logs. Since we pretty much always
want all the parallel stuff offered by the JVM, go ahead and enable parallel
reference processing to bring down your p99.9's.</p>

<pre><code># Do reference processing in parallel GC.
JVM_OPTS=&quot;$JVM_OPTS -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled&quot;
</code></pre>

<h2>CMS</h2>

<p>The 100mb/core commentary in cassandra-env.sh for setting HEAP_NEWSIZE is
<strong>wrong</strong>. A useful starting point for CMS is 25% of the heap. For some
workloads it may go as high as 50% of the heap, but start at 20-25% and see what
happens. Before moving onto testing, add the following settings derived from
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-8150">CASSANDRA-8150</a>. There's
some good stuff in there, but be careful not to haphazardly combine all the
settings from the various comments. They don't always mix well.</p>

<p>TODO: add Pierre's notes about CMS</p>

<pre><code># [http://blog.ragozin.info/2012/03/secret-hotspot-option-improving-gc.html](http://blog.ragozin.info/2012/03/secret-hotspot-option-improving-gc.html)
JVM_OPTS=&quot;$JVM_OPTS -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions&quot;

JVM_OPTS=&quot;$JVM_OPTS -XX:CMSMaxAbortablePrecleanTime=60000&quot;
JVM_OPTS=&quot;$JVM_OPTS -XX:CMSWaitDuration=30000&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>CMSScavengeBeforeRemark: triggers a Young GC (STW) before running CMS Remark
(STW) phase. The expected effect is to reduce the duration of the Remark phase.</p>

<p>CMSWaitDuration: once CMS detects it should start a new cycle, it will wait up
to that duration (in millis) for a Young GC cycle to happen. The expected effect
is to reduce the duration of the Initial-Mark (STW) CMS phase.</p>

<p>SurvivorRatio sizes the Eden and the survivors. SurvivorRatio=N means: divide
the young generation by N+2 segments, take N segments for Eden and 1 segment for
each survivor.</p>

<p>MaxTenuringThreshold defines how many young GC an object should survive before
being pushed in the old generation. A too high value increases the Young GC
pause time (because of extra copying). A too low value increases pressure on
CMS.</p>

<h2>G1GC</h2>

<p>Recommendation: pick a node, flip its cassandra-env.sh over to the config block
below, then come back here and read while that node generates some GC logs for
you to look at.</p>

<p>G1GC is the newest garbage collection backend in Hotspot. It was introduced
during Java 6 and gradually improved through Java 7 and seems to be solid for
production as of Java 8u45. I do not recommend using G1 on any JRE older than
Hotspot 8u40. There have been changes to the algorithm between u40 and u45 and I
expect more as adoption increases, so the latest release of Java 8 is
recommended. Hotspot 9 is expected default to G1GC, so it's time to start
learning how it works.</p>

<p>The main benefit of the G1 collector is what they call ergonomics.
Tuning CMS is a black art that requires
a lot of iteration to dial in. G1 is usually good out of the box and can be
dialed in with just a couple parameters to the JVM. According to the various
docs on the web, CMS shoots for 1% or less of application CPU time spent in GC
while G1 allows for up to 10%. It's a good deal at half the price, and the observed
CPU usage is usually much lower than 10%.</p>

<p>It is critical that you <strong>comment out the -Xmn line when switching to G1</strong>
Perhaps my favorite feature in G1 is that the eden size is calculated
automatically to try to meet the latency target. It also automatically sets the
tenuring threashold. It does a decent job and may even be useful to try as a way
to estimate the -Xmn for CMS (switch to G1, run a load, grep Eden
/var/log/cassandra/gc.log.0.current).</p>

<p>There are two main settings to use when tuning G1: heap size and MaxGCPauseMillis.</p>

<p>G1 can scale to over 256GB of RAM and down to 1GB (6GB minimum is recommended)
The first thing to try in many situations is to bump the heap by a few
GB and see what happens. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't. The results
are usually obvious within a few minutes, so I'll often go from 8GB to 16GB to
32GB (when available) to see if it helps. Adding more heap space allows G1 to
&quot;waste&quot; more heap on uncollected garbage that may be mixed with tenured data. If
it is under pressure to reclaim space for eden, you will see significant memory
copy time in the GC logs. That's bound by the memory bandwidth of the system and
there isn't much we can do about it, so increasing the heap to allow more slack
is the easy path.</p>

<p>The other tunable is -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=n.  The default in Hotspot 8 is 200ms.
When testing G1 on
lower-end hardware (mobile CPUs, EC2) it was observed that throughput suffered
too much with the 200ms pause target. Increasing it to 500ms keeps the average
STW pause below the default timeouts in cassandra.yaml while allowing for better
throughput. The critical thing to keep in mind is that this is a <strong>target</strong> and
nothing is guaranteed; STW on fast machines might hover around 120ms and never
even approach the target. Slower machines may exceed the target occasionally,
which is why your timeouts in cassandra.yaml should allow for some slack.</p>

<pre><code># Use the Hotspot garbage-first collector.
JVM_OPTS=&quot;$JVM_OPTS -XX:+UseG1GC&quot;

# Main G1GC tunable: lowering the pause target will lower throughput and vise versa.
# 200ms is the JVM default and lowest viable setting
# 1000ms increases throughput. Keep it smaller than the timeouts in cassandra.yaml.
JVM_OPTS=&quot;$JVM_OPTS -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=500&quot;

# Have the JVM do less remembered set work during STW, instead
# preferring concurrent GC. Reduces p99.9 latency.
JVM_OPTS=&quot;$JVM_OPTS -XX:G1RSetUpdatingPauseTimePercent=5&quot;

# Start GC earlier to avoid STW.
# The default in Hotspot 8u40 is 40%.
JVM_OPTS=&quot;$JVM_OPTS -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=25&quot;

# For workloads that do large allocations, increasing the region
# size may make things more efficient. Otherwise, let the JVM
# set this automatically.
#JVM_OPTS=&quot;$JVM_OPTS -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=32m&quot;
</code></pre>

<h2>useful GC log highlights</h2>

<p>Set up the above config and kick off some load. Start tailing the GC log and
wait for the eden size to stabilize. It often gets close within a few seconds of
running load, but give it a minute or so to be sure then start looking at the
detailed information. Each GC log section is rather large so I'm not going to
document it here. There are three lines that provide most of what we need to
know.</p>

<pre><code>[Object Copy (ms): Min: 157.6, Avg: 161.5, Max: 162.2, Diff: 4.6, Sum: 1292.0]
</code></pre>

<p>Object Copy time is embedded in a larger block of stats. With most of the
systems I've examined, this is where the vast majority of the STW time is spent,
so the trick is to tune the JVM so that it does less copying of objects. As
mentioned earlier, start with adding heap space and offheap memtables.
Compaction is particularly pragmatic (as observed through jvisualvm or sjk-plus
ttop) and there doesn't seem to be much we can do about it. Throttling
compaction can even make it worse by forcing Cassandra to keep objects in memory
longer than necessary, causing promotion which leads to memory compaction which
is bound by memory bandwidth of the system.</p>

<pre><code>[Eden: 4224.0M(4224.0M)-&gt;0.0B(4416.0M) Survivors: 576.0M-&gt;448.0M Heap: 6334.9M(8192.0M)-&gt;2063.4M(8192.0M)]
</code></pre>

<p>This is where you can see how much of the heap is being used for eden space. It
will go to 0.0B every time this is printed, since with the default logging it
only prints it after a STW. The survivors number under G1 rarely go over
1GB and usually hover in the 200-300MB range. If it goes over 1GB there might be
something wrong in the DB worth investigating. The last part, &quot;Heap:&quot;
shows the total amount of allocated heap space. This will vary the most. If it
hovers at 90-100% of the total heap, you're probably using Solr and have a lot
of data and will need a bigger heap.</p>

<pre><code>[Times: user=1.73 sys=0.00, real=0.20 secs]
</code></pre>

<p>I don't typically use these final numbers for much tuning, but they're good to
glance at every once in a while to get an idea how much of your CPU is being
burned for GC. user= represents the amount of CPU time consumed on all cores and
is usually a multiple of real=. If sys is significant relative to the other
numbers, it probably points at contention somewhere in the system (sometimes
debuggable with strace -c). Finally, the real= part is wall-clock time and will
correlate with the observable pause.</p>

<h2>Always Pre-Touch</h2>

<pre><code># Make sure all memory is faulted and zeroed on startup.
# This helps prevent soft faults in containers and makes
# transparent hugepage allocation more effective.
JVM_OPTS=&quot;$JVM_OPTS -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch&quot;
</code></pre>

<h2>Disable Biased Locking</h2>

<p>Biased locking is an optimization introduced in Hotspot 1.5 that optimizes
single-writer locks. It's a win in systems that have mostly uncontended
locking. Cassandra is a large system with many contended locks in hot paths
making this optimization counter-productive. The difference between having this
enabled/disabled is difficult to detect unless the system is running close to
full capacity.</p>

<h2>Thread Local Allocation Blocks</h2>

<p>TLABs are enabled by default in Cassandra, but the option is mixed in with some
CMS stuff so it occasionally gets dropped by accident when switching to G1 so
it's worth calling out as important. With the number of threads in play in a
Cassandra instance, it's worth also enabling TLAB resizing if only to recover
the TLAB from threads that rarely wake up or do significant allocation. Right
now this is just a theory, but being able to increase the size of TLAB is likely
a big win for Cassandra since a few threads (e.g. compaction) allocate large
amounts of memory making any opportunity to avoid a GC lock a big win. That's
the theory and although a statistically significant difference between
+/-ResizeTLAB could not be found in simple tests, this is a common and practical
optimization that should be enabled.</p>

<pre><code># Enable thread-local allocation blocks and allow the JVM to automatically
# resize them at runtime.
JVM_OPTS=&quot;$JVM_OPTS -XX:+UseTLAB -XX:+ResizeTLAB&quot;
</code></pre>

<h2>other JVM applications</h2>

<p>A good chunk of applications using Cassandra are built on the JVM. Quite often
even our own tools (e.g. cassandra-stress) have simple GC and tuning settings
that limit performance. Copying Cassandra's settings is not the answer; many of
the things that are good for Cassandra are bad for smaller/simpler apps. That
said, here's the settings I use for G1 with cassandra-stress and many of the
other tools in the distribution, as well as other JVM apps. It's not universal,
but perhaps a better starting point than the defaults.</p>

<pre><code>java -server -ea \
  -Xmx8G -Xms1G \
  -XX:+UseG1GC \
  -XX:+AggressiveOpts -XX:+UseCompressedOops \
  -XX:+OptimizeStringConcat -XX:+UseFastAccessorMethods \
  $MAIN
</code></pre>

<h1>Compaction</h1>

<p>The most visible deferred cost of writing to Cassandra is compaction. I find it
useful to describe it in terms of compound interest: you get to write at every
high throughput now (borrowing), but at some point you have to redo all that IO
(principal) with a fair amount of waste (interest) to maintain acceptable reads
(credit score).</p>

<h2>concurrent_compactors</h2>

<p>On SSDs I start at 4 and go up from there if the workload requires it. The
biggest problem with huge numbers of compactors is the amount of GC it
generates, so make sure to watch your GC logs or p99 client latency to make sure
that additional compactors doesn't ruin your latency.</p>

<p>Whether or not to throttle compactions should follow the same reasoning. With
Cassandra 2.1, compaction properly takes advantage of the OS page cache, so
read IO isn't as big of a deal as it was on 2.0. Limiting the amount of IO
allowed for compaction also cuts the amount of GC generated by the compaction
code, so it's still a good idea even on very fast storage.</p>

<h2>STCS</h2>

<p>This is the original deal and is by far the most widely deployed and tested
compaction strategy. This should be the default choice when you
don't know what to do or have insufficient information. I haven't done much
tuning of the various knobs available, so please let me know if there's anything
interesting I should be looking at.</p>

<h2>LCS</h2>

<p>Use LCS when you need to fill up disks past 50% or have
really tight read SLAs. Otherwise, stick with STCS.</p>

<p>LCS has significant issues with streaming / resulting compaction with node
densities &gt; 800GB especially. This is getting addressed in Cassandra 2.2, but is
a real issue when bootstrapping new nodes or data centers currently.</p>

<h2>DTCS</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/dtcs-notes-from-the-field">http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/dtcs-notes-from-the-field</a></p>

<h1>System RAM</h1>

<p>Cassandra uses memory in 3 ways: Java heap, offheap memory, and OS page cache
(a.k.a. buffer cache but only uncool people call it that anymore).  You want as
much RAM as you can get, up to around 256GB. For a read-heavy system it might
even make sense to go into the 512GB-2TB range (all the major server vendors
have 2TB servers now), but really you want to scale out rather than up whenever
possible.</p>

<h2>The Page Cache</h2>

<p>Cassandra relies heavily on the operating system page cache for caching of data
on disk. Every read that is served from RAM is a read that never gets
to a disk, which has a systemic effect of reducing load across the board. Every
page of RAM that is available for caching helps, which is why I'll cheerfully
recommend 128GB of RAM even though Cassandra itself only consumes a fraction of
it directly.</p>

<p><a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1814327">http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1814327</a></p>

<h2>Swap (Always Say Never)</h2>

<p>Prior to the 2000's, RAM was often the biggest line item on server quotes. I
remember spending more than $80,000 for 8GB of RAM in a PA-RISC system in ~2001.
When RAM is $10,000/GB and disk is $250/GB, swap makes sense. Even on
those systems any swap usage was catastrophic to performance, which is why the
business was willing to spend the big numbers on RAM. In today's age of &lt; $100
for an 8GB DIMM, using swap in any latency-sensitive system is silly.</p>

<p>Always disable swap. In addition, always set /proc/sys/vm/swappiness to 1 just
in case it gets reenabled by accident. The default value is 60, which tells the
kernel to go ahead and swap out applications to make room for page cache
<em>headdesk</em>. With both settings in place, the system should never swap and that's
one less thing to think about when tracking down latency problems.</p>

<p>Recommendation:</p>

<pre><code>swapoff -a
sed -i ‘s/^\(.*swap\)/#\1/' /etc/fstab
echo &quot;vm.swappiness = 1&quot; &gt; /etc/sysctl.d/swappiness.conf
sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/swappiness.conf
</code></pre>

<h2>numactl &amp; -XX:+UseNUMA</h2>

<p>The quickest way to tell if a machine is NUMA is to run &quot;numactl --hardware&quot;.</p>

<p>One of the big changes to systems in the last decade has been the move from the
Intel Pentium front-side bus architecture to Non-Uniform Memory Architecture,
a.k.a. NUMA. Really, it's two changes in one: modern x86 CPUs have integrated
the memory controller onto the same die. This means that in a multi-socket
system, there are two memory controllers. Rather than making one CPU have to ask
the other for all memory, each CPU gets a share of the memory (usually
symmetrical), and they only talk to each other when a process executing on one
CPU needs memory located on the other CPU's memory bus. There are a bunch of
optimizations in the hardware to make this as painless as possible, but as
usual, there's still a cost in latency. When an application or thread only uses
memory local to the CPU, things go really fast and when that fails, things go
slower.</p>

<p>By default, the bin/cassandra script will prepend the JVM command with
<code>numactl --interleave</code>. This is a good default that will enable decent performance on
most systems. That said, there are more options for NUMA systems that may open
up additional performance. One is to comment out the <code>numactl --interleave</code> in
bin/cassandra and add -XX:+UseNUMA to cassandra-env.sh. This instructs the JVM
to handle NUMA directly. The JVM will allocate memory across NUMA domains and,
according to docs, will divide GC across domain domains. It does not do any
thread pinning though (the code exists but is a noop on Linux). I've tested
UseNUMA with a 256GB heap and it does work, but it's not necessarily
--interleave.</p>

<p>The fastest option is for multi-JVM setups on NUMA where you can use numactl
--cpunodebind to lock a JVM to a particular NUMA node so all memory is local and
threads are not allowed to execute on remote cores. This is the highest
performance option, but does limit the process to one socket, so use it with
caution. There are also problems with availability in the face of a server
failure, so please be careful if you try this route.</p>

<h2>zone_reclaim_mode, destroyer of p99s</h2>

<p>This is usually disabled by default, but if by chance it is enabled, you will
likely observe random STW pauses caused by the kernel when zone reclaim fires.</p>

<h1>Disks</h1>

<p>The slowest part of a node is going to be either the disk or the network. Even
in the age of SSDs, it's difficult to predict which is best. A good 10gig
network can get below 40µs latency, which can keep up with SATA and SAS. This is
why we're starting to see SSD NAS become usable in the public clouds.</p>

<p>When a transaction is served entirely out of memory, the client txn latency is
roughly:</p>

<pre><code>memory_txn_latency + network_latency + client_latency
</code></pre>

<p>Cache misses are always worse:</p>

<pre><code>disk_latency + memory_txn_latency + network_latency + client_latency
</code></pre>

<p>This is not unique to Cassandra; every durable database with data &gt; RAM has to
deal with disks as the wildcard in client latency. Cache miss latency is
dominated by disk access time. No amount of magic can make that go away (though
rapid read protection may hide it).</p>

<h2>Solid State Drives (a.k.a. flash drives)</h2>

<p>Leaving transport/HBA aside for the moment, SSD is absolutely the preferred
solution for every workload. There are a few exceptions where HDD makes sense
for economical reasons, but the arguments get shaky as soon as you start looking
at the vast difference in latency and power consumption. SSDs have no moving
parts as well, so while they can fail, it's a lot more predictable if you
monitor the retired cells over SMART.</p>

<p><a href="http://techreport.com/review/27909/the-ssd-endurance-experiment-theyre-all-dead">http://techreport.com/review/27909/the-ssd-endurance-experiment-theyre-all-dead</a></p>

<p>Most flash on the market today is referred to as MLC, which usually refers to
2-level cells. This means that each flash cell can hold 2 bits of data. SLC
(Single Level Cell) is difficult to find these days and is obscenely expensive
so forget about it. Some Samsung drives are based on TLC (triple) to get 3 bits
per cell, while SanDisk has some drives at 4 bits per cell. The base
recommendation for production workloads is MLC. Some folks are testing TLC for
high-volume/low-write (DTCS) workloads and having some success. YMMV.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-level_cell">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-level_cell</a></p>

<h2>Hard Disk Drives (a.k.a. spinning rust)</h2>

<p>Hard drives get the moniker &quot;spinning rust&quot; because they are literally a few
discs made out of iron spinning while a mechanical arm moves a sensor across
them to detect changes in the magnetic field. They have served us well for
decades and are by far the cheapest storage available. They still show up in new
systems for a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>hardware vendors mark SSDs up by 100-2000%</li>
<li>7200RPM SATA is aroudn $0.05/GB while a Samsung 1TB TLC is $0.50</li>
<li>high capacity is still easier to come by</li>
</ul>

<p>You already know that SSDs are better, so when do HDDs make sense? Since the
preferred size of a Cassandra &lt;= 2.1 node is still around 4-5TB, the answer is
usually never. There are exceptions, such as mostly-write workloads + DTCS where
seeking isn't as big of a problem. Sometimes you already bought the
machine or are mitigating against drive failures elsewhere, so they have to be
made to work. The trick to getting HDDs to perform as well as possible is to
tune things for linear IO wherever possible. Sometimes this means deeper queues
<code>nomerges=0, nr_request=256</code> and sometimes it means getting more RAM. When HDDs
are the only option, get as much RAM as you can. Every cache hit in RAM means
less IO on the drive. It's not a big deal on SSDs where random IO isn't
penalized, but on an HDD that IO will probably cause a seek which is exactly the
worst thing to do to an HDD.</p>

<h2>Transports: SATA, SAS, NVMe, PCIe, and virtualized</h2>

<p>Most of the drives in production today are either SAS or SATA. SAS
HBAs are preferred over SATA even when using SATA drives. SATA drives work fine
on SAS controllers that can scale a little better. That said, in simple machines,
using the onboard AHCI SATA controller is fine. One important difference that's
useful to note is that SAS is rated at 1 undetectable error out of
10^16 bits while SATA drives are typically in the 10^15 range. While Cassandra has
multiple levels of mitigation (sstable checksums and replication), this can be a
useful way to convince people to move to SAS. Since NL-SAS is basically a
SATA drive with a SAS controller, they should have the same error correction as
SAS, but be sure to check the data sheet for the drive.</p>

<p>NVMe is the new kid on the block. It is a standard similar to AHCI for SATA or
UHCI for USB that specifies a hardware/driver and physical interface for
PCI-Express (PCIe) flash devices that is optimized for parallelism, unlike
traditional block interfaces.</p>

<p>For the next year or two it is really important to verify the kernel NVMe driver
is up-to-date. The early releases of NVMe for Linux were riddled with bugs and
missing features. Most kernels released after 2015-05 should be fine.</p>

<p><a href="https://communities.intel.com/community/itpeernetwork/blog/2015/06/09/nvm-express-linux-driver-support-decoded">https://communities.intel.com/community/itpeernetwork/blog/2015/06/09/nvm-express-linux-driver-support-decoded</a></p>

<p>PCI-Express cards such as those sold by Intel, FusionIO (now SanDisk), and
Samsung are still commonly deployed. These are by far the highest-performing
option, with latencies measured in microseconds.</p>

<p>When running in a virtualized environment, a number of new variables have to be
considered. The most common and easy to address problem is use of virtual IO
drivers rather than emulation. Most of the public cloud images are virtio-native
these days. Make sure to check. On some private clouds you may find images
misconfigured to use an emulated SCSI adapter from the 1990's or even worse, an
BX440 IDE adapter. These use significantly more CPU and memory bandwidth than
virtio drivers that cooperate with the hypervisor to provide decent performance.
That said, the best option is IOMMU access to an underlying device, but that's
fairly rare. It will be more common in the near future as cloud providers roll
out NVMe.</p>

<h2>Amazon EBS, Google PD, Azure Volumes</h2>

<p>Amazon EBS &quot;standard&quot; = BAD, AVOID AT ALL COSTS (literally!)</p>

<p>Amazon EBS &quot;io1&quot; or “gp2” = (notbad), go for it!.</p>

<p>The new SSD-backed &quot;general purpose&quot; EBS has a latency of 1ms or less most of the
time and pairs nicely with c4.4xlarge instances. Make sure the instance is EBS
optimized. Make sure to take a look at the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/details/">EBS Product Details
page</a> to see how IO bursting plays out.
Interestingly, if the volume size exceeds 3.4TB, the volume is automatically
bumped to 10,000 IOPS which is a great deal compared to io1 volumes and
especially i2.2xlarge clusters. io1 volumes are also useful but are more expensive so
consider them for the commit log, but most users will be best served by gp2.</p>

<h2>SAN/NAS</h2>

<p>Just say no. Friends don't let friends and all that. There are few exceptions to
this rule. One is the new wave of PCI-Express DAS flash sold by EMC, Netapp, and
others. These devices are quite expensive but are popping up all over the
storage industry. In some SAN/NAS shops we may be able to leverage partnerships
with the big storage vendors to bring in a managed flash device. The key to
recognizing appropriate DAS storage is when it can be deployed as one array per
rack, or one DAS box per availability zone/rack.</p>

<h2>discovery</h2>

<p>When getting acquainted with a new machine, one of the first things to do is
discover what kind of storage is installed. Here are some handy commands:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>blockdev --report</code></li>
<li><code>fdisk -l</code></li>
<li><code>ls -l /dev/disk/by-id</code></li>
<li><code>lspci -v # pciutils</code></li>
<li><code>sg_inq /dev/sda # sg3-utils</code></li>
<li><code>ls /sys/block</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>IO elevator, read-ahead, IO merge</h2>

<p>Folks spend a lot of time worrying about tuning SSDs, and that's great, but on
modern kernels these things usually only make a few % difference at best. That
said, start with these settings as a default and tune from there.</p>

<p>When in doubt, always use the deadline IO scheduler. The default IO scheduler is
CFQ, which stands for &quot;Completely Fair Queueing&quot;. This is the only elevator that
supports IO prioritization via cgroups, so if Docker or some other reason for
cgroups is in play, stick with CFQ. In some cases it makes sense to use the noop
scheduler, such as in VMs and on hardware RAID controllers, but the difference
between noop and deadline is small enough that I only ever use deadline.
Some VM-optimized kernels are hard-coded to only have noop and that's fine.</p>

<pre><code>echo 1 &gt; /sys/block/sda/queue/nomerges # SSD only! 0 on HDD
echo 8 &gt; /sys/block/sda/queue/read_ahead_kb # up to 128, no higher
echo deadline &gt; /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
</code></pre>

<p>I usually start with read_ahead_kb at 8 on SSDs and 64 on hard drives (to line
up with Cassandra &lt;= 2.2's sstable block size). With mmap IO in &lt;= 2.2 and all
configurations &gt;= 3.0. Setting readahead to 0 is fine on many configurations but
has caused problems on older kernels, making 8 a safe choice that doesn't hurt
latency.</p>

<p>Beware: setting readahead very high (e.g. 512K) can look impressive from the
system side by driving high IOPS on the storage while the client latency
degrades because the drives are busy doing wasted IO. Don't ask me how I know
this without buying me a drink first.</p>

<h2>TRIM &amp; fstrim</h2>

<p>Most SSDs and some virtual disks support some form of TRIM that allows the
operating system to inform the device when a block is no longer referenced so
that it can be erased and returned to the free space pool. This helps the disk
controller do efficient wear leveling and avoid latency spikes when the free
cell pool gets low.</p>

<p>xfs and ext4 support the 'discard' mount option, but you should not use it. The
slowest part of an SSD is erasing previously used cells. This can take an
eternity in computer time, tying up command slots and occasionally blocking
applications. No good. There is an alternative though, and that's
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/fstrim.8.html">'fstrim'</a> or the 'wiper.sh'
script from the hdparm package. Run one of them around once a week, one node at a time
just like repair so that the whole cluster doesn't hiccup at once.</p>

<h2>partitioning &amp; alignment</h2>

<p>Whenever possible, I prefer to use GPT disk labels instead of the classic MBR
partition tables. GPT offers a number of advantages such as support for drives
larger than 4TB and better resiliency through writing at both the beginning and
end of the drive. In addition, the GPT tools on Linux usually align partitions
to a 1MB boundary automatically, which avoids any potential block misalignment.</p>

<p>Here is one of the scripts I use for setting up GPT, MDRAID, and xfs. It should
be fairly easy to adapt to other environments:
<a href="https://gist.github.com/tobert/4a7ebeb8fe9446687fa8">https://gist.github.com/tobert/4a7ebeb8fe9446687fa8</a></p>

<p>Partition misalignment happens on drives with 4KB sectors, which is the size on
all SSDs and most hard drives manufactured in the last few years. Some of these
devices will emulate 512 byte blocks to support older operating systems, so you
can't rely on what Linux tells you. Since it's always safe to use 4K alignment
on 512 byte devices, it's best to always align on 4K boundaries or go with 1
megabyte to be safe. Intel's EFI specifications recommend aligning on 128MiB
boundaries, but that's just silly.</p>

<p>When deploying consumer-grade flash drives, it may make sense to leave some
space fallow either by not partitioning part of the drive or by creating a
partition that will not be used. This free space acts as an additional reservoir
of spare flash cells for the wear leveling controller in the drive to use and
may extend the useful lifetime of the drive.</p>

<h2>fio</h2>

<p>fio is the tool of choice for benchmarking filesystems and drives.</p>

<p><a href="http://tobert.github.io/post/2014-04-28-getting-started-with-fio.html">http://tobert.github.io/post/2014-04-28-getting-started-with-fio.html</a></p>

<p><a href="http://tobert.github.io/post/2014-04-17-fio-output-explained.html">http://tobert.github.io/post/2014-04-17-fio-output-explained.html</a></p>

<h1>RAID, JBOD, and LVM</h1>

<h2>JBOD</h2>

<p>It's just a bunch of disks, how hard can it be? Take a look at
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-7386">CASSANDRA-7386</a>,
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-8329">CASSANDRA-8329</a>, and
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-6696">CASSANDRA-6696</a></p>

<p>JBOD is almost always the fastest option for storage aggregation when the
software supports it, and in Cassandra's case it does, but with a few caveats. I've
avoided JBOD configs for a while because of these caveats, but it looks like its
time may finally be coming with Cassandra 2.2 and 3.0.</p>

<p>If you're stuck on huge SATA drives, definitely give it a second thought. SATA
drives in particular can benefit from JBOD rather than RAID0, since drive
failures are likely to be more painful and allowing each drive to have a
separate command queue distributes seeks better rather than having all drives do
all seeks as in RAID0.</p>

<p><a href="http://tobert.github.io/post/2014-06-17-jbod-vs-raid.html">http://tobert.github.io/post/2014-06-17-jbod-vs-raid.html</a></p>

<h2>MDRAID</h2>

<p>I don't have data to support this, but by my estimation, the majority of
Cassandra clusters in production today are using Linux's MDRAID subsystem. It
has been around for a long time and is battle-tested. Given a
choice, I will take a simple JBOD SAS controller with MDRAID over hardware RAID
every time. It's more flexible and all the tools are fairly easy to use. For
RAID0, there really isn't much hardware can do to accelerate it outside of
caching. Even when using RAID5 and RAID6, software RAID is preferrable since
parity calculation (RAID[56]) is accelerated on Intel CPUs since Westmere.</p>

<p>RAID0 is common in combination with Cassandra because it provides the simplest
management combined with good performance and capacity. Drive failures aren't a
huge deal since Cassandra is replicating the data.</p>

<p>A typical RAID0 setup looks like:</p>

<pre><code>mdadm --create /dev/md0 --chunk=256 --metadata=1.2 --raid-devices=6 --level=0 /dev/sd[cdefgh]1
</code></pre>

<p>Most of this is straightforward except for the chunk size. Most of the time the
chunk should be 64-256 bytes and should always be a power of 4096. The fio
numbers are best at 128-256K and that tends to be the size of &quot;erase blocks&quot; on
SSDs, so that's what I usually go with.</p>

<p>Of course, there are other RAID types and sometimes they make sense. It
sometimes makes sense to use RAID1 for a commit log or RAID10 in situations
where maximum availability is required or servicing hard drives is
difficult/expensiver, e.g. remote datacenters with expensive remote hands. RAID5
and RAID6 don't show up much, but I've used them with Cassandra to good effect.
You get some redundancy for the price of lower write speed (reads in modern
parity RAID are often better than you'd expect). The trick with parity RAID is
making extra sure the filesystem is informed of the stripe width so it can
allocate space in stripe-sized chunks. Always make sure to check
<code>/sys/block/md0/md/stripe_cache_size</code> and set it to 16KB or
possibly higher.</p>

<h2>HW RAID</h2>

<p>The biggest difficulty with HW RAID is that most of the CLI tools are really,
really awful. Another problem is that they present virtual block devices to the
OS, making it difficult to probe drives directly or read their SMART data.
That said, they can be set up to offer decent performance. It is often helpful
to check the firmware errata of a RAID card before chasing other parts of the
system as HW manufacturers have to ship firmware to the factory far in advance
of GA, which sometimes results in buggy firmware being shipped.</p>

<p>The other thing to keep an eye out for is write-through v.s. write-back caches
on these cards. The NVRAM on HW RAID cards is their biggest advantage, often
coming in sizes of 512MB or even bigger these days. When a battery backup is
present on the card, write-back caching can provide incredible speedups. The
battery is necessary to keep the NVRAM online during a power failure so any
outstanding IOs can be flushed to stable storage when the power comes back.
These batteries have to be serviced every few years, so some users will opt
out of the cost and hassle. In that case, it can still be set to write-through
caching for some additional performance, but most of the time I'd opt for a JBOD
card + MDRAID to with plenty of RAM keep things simple.</p>

<h2>LVM / device-mapper</h2>

<p>TODO: evaluate <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/device-mapper/cache.txt">dm-cache</a></p>

<p>TODO: evaluate dm-delay for latency simulation</p>

<p>The Linux kernel includes a block IO virtualization layer called device-mapper.
The current LVM system is built on top of this and closely resembles the LVM
from HP-UX. Most of the time, LVM is only in the way on Cassandra systems, but
it does show up frequently since many enterprises use LVM for all of
their disk management. The Redhat/CentOS/Fedora installers default to installing
the OS on an LV, so it's bound to show up.</p>

<p>The critical commands to know are <code>vgdisplay -v</code> and <code>vgscan</code>. vgdisplay will
show you all of the volume groups on a system and with -v it will also show you
the LVs and PVs. vgscan will scan all the drives in the system looking for LVM
PV signatures.</p>

<p>LVM also includes mirroring and striping modules based on dm-raid. These can be
used in place of MDRAID, but given the complexity in LVM,
my recommendation is to stick with MDRAID. This may change as time marches on
and dm-cache becomes a little easier to use.</p>

<p>Since LVM is built on device-mapper, you can find LVs by running <code>ls /dev/mapper/</code>.
This is why you'll often see <code>/dev/mapper</code> in the device name in
mount listings. The /dev/$VG/ paths are symlinks to the devmapper devices.
Another useful trick is to use the dmsetup command directly. This gives you
low-level access behind LVMs back to examine disk layouts. In particular,
<code>dmsetup ls</code> is useful.</p>

<h1>Filesystems &amp; Mount options &amp; other urban legends</h1>

<p>Cassandra relies on a standard filesystem for storage. The choice of
filesystem and how it's configured can have a large impact on performance.</p>

<p>One common performance option that I find amusing is the <code>noatime</code> option. It
used to bring large gains in performance by avoiding the need to write to inodes
every time a file is accessed. Many years ago, the Linux kernel changed the
default atime behavior from synchronous to what is called <code>relatime</code> which means
the kernel will batch atime updates in memory for a while and update inodes only
periodically. This removes most of the performance overhead of atime, making the
noatime tweak obsolete.</p>

<p>Another option I've seen abused a few times is the barrier/nobarrier flag. A
filesystem barrier is a transaction marker that filesystems use to tell
underlying devices which IOs need to be committed together to achieve
consistency. Barriers may be disabled on Cassandra systems to get better disk
throughput, but this should NOT be done without full understanding of what
it means. Without barriers in place, filesystems may come back from a power
failure with missing or corrupt data, so please read the mount(8) man page first
and proceed with caution.</p>

<h2>xfs (just do it)</h2>

<p>xfs is the preferred filesystem for Cassandra. It is one of most mature
filesystems on Earth, having started in SGI Irix, now with well over a decade in
the Linux kernel. It offers great performance over time and can be tuned to
support a variety of underlying storage configurations.</p>

<p>mkfs.xfs will try to detect drive and RAID settings automatically. It almost
always gets this wrong because the Linux kernel gets it wrong because most
drives lie to the operating system in order to support ancient operating systems
that hard-coded 512 byte blocks. All of that is to say, when creating new
filesystems, always explicitly set the block size and RAID parameters to be sure
they're correct.</p>

<p>For partitions or whole drives, setting just the block size should be
sufficient. Nearly every drive sold in the last few years has a 4K block size.
Setting a 4K block size on a 512 byte device doesn't hurt much, while setting a
512 byte block size on a 4K device causes extra work for the drive in the form
of read-modify write for 512 byte block updates. TL;DR, always set -s size=4096.</p>

<pre><code>mkfs.xfs -s size=4096 /dev/sdb1
</code></pre>

<p>And on a RAID device (adjust to the local configuration):</p>

<pre><code>mkfs.xfs -s size=4096 -d su=262144 -d sw=6 /dev/md0
</code></pre>

<p>This is a potential SSD optimization but the data so far is inconclusive. It
doesn't seem to hurt anything though, so I'm mentioning it in hopes that someone
else will figure out if it's worth the effort. The idea is to set the stripe
width to the erase block size of the underlying SSD, usually 128K (256 * 512)
and then set the stripe unit (a.k.a. chunk size) to 4K (8 * 512) to match the
block size.</p>

<pre><code>mkfs.xfs -f -s size=4096 -d sunit=8 -d swidth=256 /dev/sdb1
</code></pre>

<p>If you're setting the sunit/swidth, it's worth passing the same values through
to mount via mount -o or /etc/fstab. The man page says these only need to be set
when changing the geometry of a RAID device, but when they're not set the kernel
reports the wrong values for them, so to be safe always set them in /etc/fstab.</p>

<h2>ext4 (if you must)</h2>

<p>The ext4 filesystem is evolved from the ext line of filesystems in the Linux
kernel. It is almost as fast as ext2 was, and much faster than ext3. ext2 and
ext3 filesystems can be upgraded in-place to ext4 and you should do so,
especially for ext3. While ext2 is a bit faster than ext4 due to the lack
of a journal, it is not recommended since it will block reboots on fsck after
power failures.</p>

<p>Choose ext4 when the local policy demands it and follow the same RAID alignment
guidance as xfs.</p>

<h2>ZFS (if you love yourself and don't need commercial support)</h2>

<p>ZFS-on-Linux has been around for a few years now and is quite stable. I've
deployed Cassandra on ZFS and it's a beautiful fit. The big downside is that
there's no commercial support available. One feature that works particularly
well with Cassandra is ZFS's SLOG and L2ARC devices, which allow you to use an
SSD for journaling and caching in front of slower drives. It also offers inline
compression which may be handy for getting better compression ratios than those
built into Cassandra.</p>

<p><a href="http://zfsonlinux.org/">http://zfsonlinux.org/</a></p>

<h2>btrfs</h2>

<p>btrfs has a reputation for being unreliable and should not be deployed to
production systems without extensive testing to see if it's safe for your
workload. I've run btrfs in production with Cassandra in the past and it worked
great, particularly on EC2 ephemeral disks with LZO compression enabled. Your
mileage will certainly vary, so only choose btrfs if you're willing to risk
some data and spend the time testing.</p>

<h1>Network</h1>

<p>It often surprises me how little discussion there is around network design and
optimization. Cassandra is completely reliant on the network, and while we do a
good job of not trusting it, a little extra work in setting things up can make
the experience much smoother and provide better performance and availability.</p>

<p>Kernel tuning for network throughput is in the Linux section of this doc.</p>

<h2>NIC selection (1g/10g/vNIC/etc.)</h2>

<p>Prior to Cassandra 2.1, my guidance around networking was &quot;use 1gig,
whatever&quot;. With 2.1, however, it's quite a bit easier to push machines to the
limit of the network. Saturating 1g interfaces is fairly easy with large write
workloads. 10gig is now the recommendation for high-performance clusters.</p>

<p>When you're stuck dealing with virtual machines, avoid emulated NICs at
all costs. These usually show up as a Realtek or Intel e1000 adapter in the
guest operating system and the performance is abysmal. On KVM and
VirtualBox it should be &quot;virtio-net&quot;, for Xen, it's &quot;xen-net&quot; (IIRC), and on
VMware it should be “vmxnet3”. While the virtual NICs are much better than
emulated NICs, the best option is often referred to as vNICs. These are usually
10gig cards that can negotiate with the hypervisor to create shards of the NIC
that can be mapped directly into the guest operating system's kernel as a
hardware device. This bypasses a lot of memory copying and CPU time and allows
for nearly 100% bare metal performance inside a VM. In EC2 this is known as
enhanced networking, which should always be enabled when available.</p>

<h2>packet coalescing &amp; EC2</h2>

<p>If you're hitting a performance limit in EC2 and don't have enhanced networking
enabled, you're probably hitting the secret packets-per-second limit in EC2.
There are two ways to get around this. Either enable enhanced networking (which
requires VPC), or enable message coalescing in Cassandra (available in 2.1.5 or
DSE 4.7.0).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/performance-doubling-with-message-coalescing">http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/performance-doubling-with-message-coalescing</a></p>

<h1>CPUs: cores, sockets, hyperthreading, and power management</h1>

<p>Today's x86 CPUs are all multi-core and most of the Intel chips offer something
called hyper-threading that makes the core count appear to double. More on that
below. A system with more than one physical CPU installed is said to be
multi-socket, in that the motherboard has multiple CPU sockets with associated
memory banks (see NUMA above). Just to make sure the terminology is straight: a
node is a single motherboard with one or more CPU sockets with memory banks. A
CPU may have many processing cores.</p>

<p>While Cassandra runs fine on many kinds of processors, from Raspberry Pis to
Macbooks to high-end servers, all production loads should use a CPU that supports
ECC memory to avoid silent memory corruption.</p>

<p>When choosing CPUs, the #1 most important feature to select for is <strong>cache</strong>. An
L1 cache hit is 0.5 nanoseconds. L2 is 7ns. Reading from RAM takes 100ns. In
reality, RAM is even slower than that in a multi-core world, since cores often
need to synchronize to make sure they're not mutating the same area of memory.
The more cache there is on the CPU, the less often this happens.</p>

<p>There are usually one or two CPU models in the sweet spot of price/performance.
The way to find it is to look at the distribution of cache sizes first and find
the cache size just below that of the most expensive CPU. For example, if the
top-end Xeon has 32MB of cache and costs $2000 each, there's probably a
different CPU for around $600 that has 24MB of cache with a clock speed right
around halfway between the slowest and fastest. This where the best value is.
You're almost always better off buying more systems to spread the work out
rather than paying the markup on the fastest CPU available.</p>

<h2>a word on hyperthreading</h2>

<p>A hyperthread is a virtual core or &quot;sibling&quot; core that allows a single core to
pretend as if it's 2 cores. They exist to get more work out of the silicon by
pipelining multiple tasks in parallel for the same backing silicon. Many
databases advise that this be turned off, but overall it's a benefit for
Cassandra.</p>

<p>Recommendation: enable HT</p>

<p>EC2 note: the newer generations of EC2 instances seem to be claiming
hyperthreading cores as real cores. If you take a look at /proc/cpuinfo on an
i2.2xlarge, you will see 8 cores assigned to the system. If you look a little
closer, you can see the &quot;sibling id&quot; field indicates that half of those cores
are indeed hyperthreading cores, so you in effect only have 4 cores worth of
silicon in those VMs.</p>

<h2>C-states &amp; frequency scaling</h2>

<p>See also: &quot;powertop&quot; under observation tools.</p>

<p>Over the last few years, the cost of power for datacenters has become a more and
more prominent consideration when buying hardware. To that end, even Xeon
processors now have power management features built into them and a lot of the
time this stuff is enabled out of the box. The impact on Cassandra is that when
a processor goes into power saving mode, there is a latency cost for waking it
back up. Sometimes it's a few microseconds, sometimes it's in the milliseconds.
This is fine for a lot of applications that don't use the CPU all the time or
are not latency-sensitive, it can significantly impact throughput and even the
stability of the clock when misconfigured.</p>

<p>On RHEL6, CentOS6, and other older LTS distros, the default idle driver for
Intel chips is called &quot;intel_idle&quot;. This driver is very aggressive about
putting the processor to sleep and regularly causes client-visible latency
hiccups. To disable it, add &quot;intel_idle.max_cstate=0 processor.max_cstate=0
idle=mwait&quot; to the kernel command line then reboot. This is not necessary on
RHEL7 and similarly modern distros. The idle driver can be verified with
<code>cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuidle/current\_driver</code>. There is also a nuclear option
available on Linux in the form of booting with <code>idle=poll</code>. This is <strong>absolutely
not</strong> recommended for general use; it makes the CPU run at 100% 24x7 which may
shorten the lifetime of the hardware and wastes a lot of power. That said, it
can be handy to use it when you're in doubt and want to entirely eliminate CPU
sleeping as a source of latency.</p>

<p>Another thing I've seen recently is machines that get configured with frequency
scaling on by default. Frequency scaling is great on laptops where minimum power
consumption is more important than throughput, but it has particularly nasty
side-effects for Cassandra. The first is that with the CPUs running at lower
clock speeds, latency will be higher. Another is that performance will be
inconsistent. Lastly, and most nastily, it seems to destabilize the tsc clock on
the system which may cause time drift.</p>

<pre><code># make sure the CPUs run at max frequency
for sysfs_cpu in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu[0-9]*
do
     echo performance &gt; $sysfs_cpu/cpufreq/scaling_governor
done
</code></pre>

<h2>clock sources</h2>

<p>The vast majority of Cassandra instances run on x86 CPUs, where
there are multiple clock sources available. The fastest and most common is
called &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Stamp_Counter">tsc</a>&quot; which stands
for Time Stamp Counter. This is a register on x86 CPUs, so it is very fast. It
has a major downside in that it isn't guaranteed to be stable. This is part of
the reason why x86 machines have so much clock drift, making NTP a requirement
for every Cassandra node. There are alternatives available, such as HPET, ACPI,
and the various paravirtual clocks (kvm, xen, hyperv). The problem with these
clocks is that they sit on a bus and take an order of magnitude or more time to
read results compared to tsc. For some applications, like Cassandra, that hammer
on the gettimeofday() syscall to get the system time, it can have a direct
impact on performance.</p>

<p>Some of the clouds are starting to move over to using paravirtual clocks,
presumably to reduce the amount of clock drift in VMs. The xen paravirtual clock
in particular has been observed by Netflix to cause performance problems, so
it's a good idea to switch back to tsc, then double-check that NTP is working.</p>

<pre><code>echo tsc &gt; /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource

<h1>Linux</h1>

<h2>sysctl.conf</h2>

<p>The primary interface for tuning the Linux kernel is the /proc virtual
filesystem. In recent years, the /sys filesystem has expanded on what /proc
does.  Shell scripts using echo and procedural code are difficult to manage
automatically, as we all know from handling cassandra-env.sh. This led the
distros to create /etc/sysctl.conf, and in modern distros, /etc/sysctl.conf.d.
The sysctl command reads the files in /etc and applies the settings to the
kernel in a consistent, declarative fashion.</p>

<p>The following is a block of settings I use almost every server I touch. Most
of these are safe to apply live and should require little tweaking from site to
site. Note: I have NOT tested these extensively with multi-DC, but most of them
should be safe. Those items that may need extra testing for multi-DC have
comments indicating it.</p>

<h2>limits.conf (pam_limits)</h2>

<p>The DSE and DSC packages install an /etc/security/limits.d/ file by default that
should remove most of the problems around pam_limits(8). Single-user systems
such as database servers have little use for these limitations, so I often turn
them off globally using the following in /etc/security/limits.conf. Some
users may already be customizing this file, in which case change all of the
asterisks to cassandra or whatever the user DSE/Cassandra is running as.</p>

<pre><code>* - nofile     1000000
* - memlock    unlimited
* - fsize      unlimited
* - data       unlimited
* - rss        unlimited
* - stack      unlimited
* - cpu        unlimited
* - nproc      unlimited
* - as         unlimited
* - locks      unlimited
* - sigpending unlimited
* - msgqueue   unlimited
</code></pre>

<h2>chrt</h2>

<p>The Linux kernel's default policy for new processes is SCHED_OTHER. The
SCHED_OTHER policy is designed to make interactive tasks such as X windows and
audio/video playback work well. This means the scheduler assigns tasks very
short time slices on the CPU so that other tasks that may need immediate service
can get time. This is great for watching cat videos on Youtube, but not so great
for a database, where interactive response is on a scale of milliseconds rather
than microseconds. Furthermore, Cassandra's threads park themselves properly.
Setting the scheduling policy to SCHED_BATCH seems more appropriate and can
open up a little more throughput. I don't have good numbers on this yet, but
observations of dstat on a few clusters have convinced me it's useful and
doesn't impact client latency.</p>

<pre><code>chrt --batch 0 $COMMAND
chrt --batch 0 --all-tasks --pid $PID
</code></pre>

<p>You can inject these into cassandra-env.sh or
/etc/{default,sysconfig}/{dse,cassandra} by using the $$ variable that returns
the current shell's pid. Child processes inherity scheduling policies, so if you
set the startup shell's policy, the JVM will inherit it. Just add this line to
one of those files:</p>

<pre><code>chrt --batch --pid 0 $$
</code></pre>

<h2>taskset &amp; isolcpus &amp; irqbalance</h2>

<p>Sometimes a machine ends up spending more time processing IO requests
(interrupts) than it does getting application (Cassandra) work done. This often
manifests as high system CPU time and a large amount of context switches and
interrupts observed in vmstat/dstat. There are two major approaches to handling
this. One is to reserve a core or two for interrupt processing. This is common
in real-time use cases such as music production or high-frequency trading. The
other is to evenly distribute interrupts over the cores in a system. One of the
difficult-to-observe benefits of a reserved CPU core is that the kernel's code
can stay hot in cache on that core. The reserved core may never surpass 10%
utilization, but the latency benefits are sometimes worth it.</p>

<h2>taskset</h2>

<p>The easiest way to get started on a running system is with the taskset utility.
Taskset can be used to tell the Linux scheduler which CPUs are available to a
process or thread. The results of taskset are usually observable within a couple
seconds. After moving load off one of the cores, it may be necessary to manually
move interrupts over to the core.</p>

<pre><code>taskset -apc 2-7 $CASS_PID
taskset -c 2-7 ./cassandra -f
taskset -pc 2-7 $$ # in /etc/{default,sysconfig}/{dse,cassandra}
</code></pre>

<h2>isolcpus</h2>

<p>If you can reboot, you can reserve cores for the kernel by using the isolcpus=
kernel command line option. In my tests, the kernel automatically schedules its
tasks on the reserved CPU. You may need to do some additional IRQ management to
get it right, but it's worth the effort when it works out. In order to enable it
you will need to edit the grub configuration in /etc/default/grub on Debian or
/etc/sysconfig/grub on Redhat. For quick tests you can edit /boot/grub/grub.conf
(grub2) or /boot/grub/menu.lst (grub1 &amp; pvgrub (EC2)) and add it to the end of
the kernel options. This will probably get reverted on the next kernel
upgrade, so make sure to do it in the way prescribed by the Linux distribution.
My test machine's /proc/cmdline looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>BOOT_IMAGE=../vmlinuz-linux root=PARTUUID=91012260-6834-425a-b488-9dd9f537a294 rw isolcpus=0-1 initrd=../initramfs-linux.img
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure irqbalance is disabled or configured to wire interrupts to the
selected CPU. On NUMA machines it's important to make sure the reserved core is
on the socket that manages the PCIe devices. Core 0 is almost always the right
choice.</p>

<h2>irqbalance</h2>

<p>Some of the advice you'll find on the internet says to disable irqbalance for
performance. This was good advice for early versions of it that were prone to
rebalancing storms, but it isn't bad these days. If in doubt, disable the
irqbalance service and run &quot;irqbalance --oneshot&quot; once at boot time and forget
about it.</p>

<h2>dirty tricks with renice, ionice, and taskset</h2>

<p>This is one of my favorite dirty tricks, combined with renice/ionice. If you've
ever noticed the &quot;-XX:+UseThreadPriorities -XX:ThreadPriorityPolicy=42&quot; settings
in Cassandra's JVM arguments, they're there so that compaction can be set to a
lower priority than other threads in Cassandra. This is visible in the default
htop configuration in the nice field.</p>

<p><img src="image_14.png" alt="image alt text" />
</p>

<p>Linux has always used a 1:1 threading model and even uses the global pid space
to assign ids to threads, so they're still visible if you know how to look for
them. htop displays thread ids by default and standard top can do it if you hit
H. With ps, the -L flag makes them show up. We can take advantage of this to do
some prioritization and pinning outside of Cassandra so we don't have to wait
around for features to make their way into DSE.</p>

<pre><code>for tid in $(ps -eLo tid,args,nice |awk '/java.*4$/{print $1}')
do
  taskset -pc 5-6 $tid     # pin to cores 5 and 6
  renice 20 $tid           # set the lowest nice priority
  ionice -c 2 -n 7 -p $tid # set IO to the lowest best-effort priority
done
</code></pre>

<p>After that, your htop will look more like this (load is done but compaction is still going):</p>

<p><img src="image_15.png" alt="image alt text" />
</p>

<p>Note: ionice requires the cfq IO scheduler, which is usually not the case in
properly tuned systems. It is one of the main reasons for sticking with CFQ
outside of Docker with io limits.</p>
